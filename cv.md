3. I'm already working as a programmer, it's just that my girlfriend wanted to try programming, so I decided to help her, at the same time I would improve my basic knowledge myself. My work experience is 2 years. 
4. My real strengths are working with SQL databases. I'm also familiar with JS, React/Redux, and I'm actively learning .NET and AWS at the moment.
5. Code example:
    * *SQL:* 
    ```
    select id, 
           ASCII(name) as name, 
           birthday, 
           ASCII(race) as race 
    from demographics
    ```
    * *JS:* 
    ```
    var countBits = function(n) {
      if (n >= 0) {
        var bitNumber = n.toString(2);
        var strNumber = bitNumber.toString();
        var count = strNumber.split(1).length-1
        return count;
      }
    };
    
    describe("Basic tests", () => {
      it("Testing for fixed tests", () => {
        assert.strictEqual(countBits(0), 0);
        assert.strictEqual(countBits(4), 1);
        assert.strictEqual(countBits(7), 3);
        assert.strictEqual(countBits(9), 2);
        assert.strictEqual(countBits(10), 2);
      })
   })
    ```
